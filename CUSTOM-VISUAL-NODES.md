library
  - if you want to ever put stuff into microflo than this is not a good ideea since you're mixing components
    of visual with logic
  - what about logic pack - aka nodes pack + ui pack complement and linking them up in the index?
    - need two mounting points for components so library is no longer library


inside of noflo-ui
  - probably bad
  - fast dev
